# Boston Housing
The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avish5787/boston-data-set

### You are required to:

1. Check the summary statistics and make statements on all features using all statistical properties (mean, 50th percentile, 75% percentile, max, standard deviation).
1. Conduct univariate analysis to identify some patterns in the datasets. This should include graphs, charts, and descriptions
1. Conduct bi-variate analysis, including correlation tests and scatterplots and describe your findings. Are any of the predictors associated with per capita crime rate? If so, explain the relationship
1. Split your data using a ratio of 80:20
1. Explain potential complications of using train_test_split function in terms of reproducibility.
1. Check to see if there is any multicollinearity. If yes, remove features that can be a potential problem when building a linear regression to predict housing prices.
1. Build a linear regression model on the important features of the training set and make your interpretation on the results of the models. Provide a justification on why those selected features are important.
1. Write the linear equation to predict the price of a house. Make interpretations on the regression coefficients
1. Check the performance of the newly built model on both training and test sets, using RMSE, MAPE and MAE. Make a conclusion on the performance of the model.
1. Apply the cross-validation technique using SKLEARN package. Suggestion: using 10 folds of data division is good enough. Use R-squared and Mean Squared Error to make a conclusion on the performance of the linear regression.
